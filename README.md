# BlockCharging
40% of all energy generated by PV is wasted... Futher this number tends to increase due to a considerable growth in self-production.
Besides, the electric vehicles market is rising fast and there are only 510 fast chargers in Portugal!

**BlockCharging** presents a solution for both of these problems!!

## The concept
BlockCharging directly **connects companies with an excess of energy, with private electrical vehicle owners**.
To establish this link, our team of innovators developed a novel mobile application that enables the company to make the charging infrastructure available to the community and sell the generated surplus energy.

Supported by Ethereum Smart Contracts, the platform creates an independent marketplace where more competitive energy prices can be adopted, representing revenues for this company and savings for the car owners, a clear **WIN WIN situation**!

## Technologies

In this repository:
- [SQL database](https://github.com/jamilsonjr/BlockCharging-Prototype/tree/main/Database): saving charging spots data and personal data from the clients;
- [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/jamilsonjr/BlockCharging-Prototype/tree/main/Blockchain_System): smart contract based prototype of the electric charging marketplace created for BlockCharging.

## Who are we?
The Blockcharging team is composed of multicultural, multi-background and young innovators. Our main goal is to transform the way that we charge our vehicles with breakthrough technology. We believe that the future is electric!
